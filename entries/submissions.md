Qualifications in notable [0ver.org](https://0ver.org) entries:

* A current ZeroVer-compliant version (`0.*`) or long history of ZeroVer usage, and
* Very wide exposure (i.e., 1,000+ GitHub stars), or
* Active promotion as part of a paid product or service (e.g., Hashicorp Vault), or
* Relative maturity and infrastructural importance (e.g., Compiz, docutils)
